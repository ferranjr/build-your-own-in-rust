# Build Your Own Load Balancer
Inspired by https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-web-server/ my ongoing attempt to build a Web Server using RUST as a way to learn more about the language and gain some experience.

Currently, using:
* https://tokio.rs/ as async runtime

# Current State
* [x] Step 0. We are using RUST
* [x] Step 1. Http Server listening on port `8080` and handle single connection

# Running Locally
